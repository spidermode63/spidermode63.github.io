    <p>Whooooo, the chills, where do I start?</p>
    <p>You got the complete black empty of the void</p>
    <p>And this fucking contrast with the absolute brightness of any object that dare exist within a couple ten or so AU of a star</p>
    <p>And it's not exactly white, but not exactly dark, and you just get this brilliant grey tone, for anything that exists there.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>And then there's the silence.</p>
    <p>In space, no one can hear you scream, and it's true.</p>
    <p>You only hear your own voice, the hum of life support, and your breath.</p>
    <p>Silence, except maybe the click of something your holding or a slight muffled bump when you touch something.</p>
    <p>But aside from that, there is nothing. Absolutely nothing...</p>
    <hr>
    <p>And there's the danger. It's not like the movies. When a spacesuit ruptures. You are dead. There is no escaping that fact.</p>
    <p>Sure, there are about 15 seconds of some semblance of life, but if anyone could actually save you that quickly I'd probably have partner who loves me</p>
    <p>You'd be dead, right there.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>And there's the temperature. It is not cold. It is not hot. It is not warm. It is just, space.</p>
    <p>The only heat is literal particles off the Sun blowing around you, too small and far apart to be seen, but deadly and cancerous.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>So, if someone says space is boring, give them a cold cheeseburger with onions on it because they'll never understand the pure amount of just fhdjksahfjkdas in space.</p>
