    <p>Scale. Space is big. Large even. Ok. I already got it across that it's fucking massive, but what does that mean?</p>
    <p>Alright, so numbers mean nothing to you. good point, I don't like them either. <em>OooOh LoOoK ItS TeN BiLlIoN BiLlIoN LIgHtYeaRs I mOsT CeRtaINly DiDn'T jUsT LosE EvErYtHiNg WhEn YoU SaiD ThAT</em></p>
    <p>So, how big is the Universe?</p>
    <p>Let's start small. How big is your computer monitor. Well fuck if I know but you've probably got a good idea of it.</p>
    <p>I'd say more than likely it's about a 20th the width of your bedroom. Viewing on mobile? Your screen's probably like 1 100th the width of the bedroom.</p>
    <p>So that's what a hundredth of something is. Pretty small in comparison?</p>
    <p>Your house. You probably have an ok decent idea of that, right? It's like your room, but cubed or something. It's a bit big.</p>
    <p>How big then, can life be?</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Life, at it's largest, appears to be a Whale, as far as Earth goes. They're pretty fucking big. The biggest one's probably  like twice the size of your house.</p>
    <p>So, how much of the world is a whale?</p>
    <p>Let's say, for extremely cruel purposes, we stretch the whale out into a cube of about 15 meters. How big is that?</p>
    <img src="whale cube.png" width="50%">
    <p>Well, to you, it's pretty big, but, to the city of chicago, it would be about 0.00398315391% of all landmass in that city.</p>
    <p>NO! NOT NUMBERS! I HATE NUMBERS!</p>
    <p>Okay, well, how does four thousandths sound? Small, but not too small to imagine. Imagine the width of a hair compared to the length of the 2nd segment in your middle finger. Not terrible, but that's the size of the whale cube.</p>
    <p>Well that's bearable. How big is Chicago to say, Earth?</p>
    <img src="chicagoearth.png" width="50%">
    <p>Woah. Feel it now? Take a piece of hair and put it on your finger. That finger segment is equal to that little grey spot by lake michigan! And that hair is the whale cube!</p>
    <p>So by now the world probably feels a whole lot smaller, but that's just a bit deceiving. Viewing Earth from that angle makes it seem a bit smaller than it is.</p>

    <p>So, Chicago isn't as big as you thought, but still, it's good in comparison to the face of the Earth here.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You might as well lay your middle finger on your bed and the ratio of middle finger:bed will be about as much as Chicago:hemisphere here.</p>
