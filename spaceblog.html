    <h1>Space Blog???</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I rant abt space and science. I am prone to saying things that are incorrect occasionally bc I'm still trying to learn as much as I can abt this awesome stuff. If I'm wrong about any of this please  <a href="mailto:theaustinator007@gmail.com">email</a> me and say something! I would love to clarify my understanding of these things because I want to work on them in the future.</p>

        <h3>1-The first one</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I am very intruigued abt all of the wires and pipes and stuff on starships so ig that's the first thing I need to learn abt. To start: I know that a raptor engine requires methane, liquid oxygen, and inert gas, and an electric arc to start. However, I do not see mechanisms to deliver inert gas to the engines on starship, only superheavy. That would make sense as COPVs are very large and would not fit on starship so would those engines be started by electric motors? I have no idea. That's abt all I have to say for now ig.</p>
