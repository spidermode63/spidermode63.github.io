      <pubDate>Fri, 2 Oct 2020 13:06:12 -0700</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<H1 align="center">HOW TO DEEPFRY AN IMAGE IN GNU IMAGE MANIPULATION PROGRAM</H1>
<p>
<HR width="100%">
Here are the steps: 
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Find the funniest thing you've ever seen and paste it into gimp 
<li>Go to the top bar 
<li>Go to Image-&gt;Canvas Size 
<li>Break the chain between Length/Width values by left-clicking it 
<li>Widen the canvas 
<li>Widen the image with the scale tool under Transform 
<li>In the top bar, find Color-&gt;Brightness/Contrast 
<li>Turn up contrast, turn down brightness, and play a bit with values to find the right mix. 
<li>Go to filters and play with them. Best ones listed below 
<li>Filters-&gt;Generic-&gt;Erode 
<li>Filters-&gt;Distortion-&gt;Spherize 
<li>Filters-&gt;Blur-&gt;Circular Motion Blur 
<li>Filters-&gt;Noise-&gt;Hurl 
<li>Add Text if needed 
<li>Store in some obscure folder like "C:/Users/Austin/Pictures/Victims of Gimp" 
<li>Just export it though, saving is not required and just wastes space in this case. 
<li>Put it on social media with no context 
<li>Put it on social media with strange context</li></ul>

      <title>MARS IS NOT HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</title>

<H1>MARS ISN'T HOT</H1>
<HR>

<p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. People think that just because it's red it's hot. It is -400 degrees. That's cold!!! The only reason it's red is because it's made of iron, which has rusted over time. Which also means that there is oxygen in the armosphere so you people may say "Oh so you can breathe in it?" No you can't breathe in it, the oxygen is stored inside of Carbon Dioxide which is not breathable. And there are tiny dust particles floating around so that will try to kill you too.</p>
<HR>

<p>Thanks for reading : )</p></div>
