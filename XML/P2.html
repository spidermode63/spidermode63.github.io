    <HR>

    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. People think that just because it's red it's hot. It is -400 degrees. That's cold!!! The only reason it's red is because it's made of iron, which has rusted over time. Which also means that there is oxygen in the armosphere so you people may say "Oh so you can breathe in it?" No you can't breathe in it, the oxygen is stored inside of Carbon Dioxide which is not breathable. And there are tiny dust particles floating around so that will try to kill you too.</p>
