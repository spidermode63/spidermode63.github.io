    <title>Deorbit</title>
    <p>You suddenly hear a lound clank. You are drowned in darkness. 
        Then, a loud clap sounds and you are shaken in your seat. Finally, you are pushed
        back into your seat. It feels like someone is laying on you. An experience you 
        have likely never had if you are playing this game. This continues for a solid minute. 
        You sit in the stuffy air for hours on end. You think "this is it. I will die alone."
        Then, the whole world falls out of your ears. Ummm... Wait got that wrong... You fall into
        the whole world. Sound returns to your silence. The rushing of air. You look out a window,
        and suddenly, it explodes in blinding brightness. A bright jet of hot plasma rushes past
        the glass. Then, the glass begins to burn and darken. The lights go out.
        The lights come on. Then, the windows one again explode in a blinding light, this time, of
        the sun shining through the darkness. The void immediately turns a violent shade of dark
        blue as you plummet towards the surface. With a jerk, 3 parachutes deploy. Then clouds appear
        above you. After all that, you slam into the hard ground with a painful thunk.
