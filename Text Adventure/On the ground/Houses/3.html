    <p>When you enter, you are engulfed in infinity itself.
        You stand on a glass plane floating in the void.
        The void isn't exactly white, but it certainly
        isn't black either. It is really no color in particular.
        It is like ehen you close one eye. You can't see
        what the back of that eyelid is like. Your brain
        temporarily erases it from your grasp.
