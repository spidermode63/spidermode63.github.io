    <title>Death by hypoxia</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>You happen to feel you may be in space, so you instinctively hold your breath before opening the hatch. When the hatch opens, a great, strong wind blows around you.
        The pressure difference between your lungs and the space around you is too great. Not holding your breath would have bought you 15 extra seconds. Now, your lungs
        undergo a rapid unscheduled dissasembly, releasing 12 litres of blood and oxygen into space. It immediately boils off into a cloud. Through crusty watering eyes, your last
        sight is that of beauty: A red, spherical mist floating in an endless void with the magnificent planet of the human race hanging below you.
