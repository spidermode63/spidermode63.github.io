    <h2>Adventure Begins!!!</h2>
    <p>You find yourself in a white, cylindrical room. You feel weightless. There is a small window ahead, only a few cm in width.
        To your right, is a thick, pale hatch. To your left, is a small, round hole, about the size of your shoulders. You might fit through.
