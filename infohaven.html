    <h1>Welcome to CS-AU-GAIA-US17</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>This is CS-AU-GAIA-US17, or just my little internet area I guess. There will probably be misspleings and mistakes that are grammatically not aligned really actually. I encourage you not to waste too much time here,
        but if you want, you can stay as long as you like. I will provide some links for interesting CS artifacts if you want to look at them. There's also some
        stuff I made on here if you want to see it. I made this at like 23:02 so I'm pretty fucking tired, so I'm gonna go get some tea before continuing.
    </p>

    <p>Who am I? Glad you asked (not really it doesn't matter and you never asked). I am an overambitious 14 year old nerd. 
        I play clarinet and kalimba, and I have 4 cats. I do 3d modelling in <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender3D</a>
         and draw sometimes. My favorite color is blue. My pronouns are he/him. Everything else, I will hide under the veil of anonimity.
          Oh and I want to start a space company I think.</p>
