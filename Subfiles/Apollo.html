<p>Info: Apollo 20 was an Apollo mission piloted by Neil Armstrong, commanded by Gilbert Harris, and navigated by the first <br> American female astronaut, Janet Armstrong whom was still deemed as "too skilled as a navigator role
    " to land on the Moon as stated by an unknown ground <br> control member. This is why she was navigator and was left behind in the command module while the mission took place. The purpose of this mission was 
    <br>to set the foundation for the first Lunar base near an icy cave network near Tranquility Base.</p>
