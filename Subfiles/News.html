    <p>1- Not only was cocaine used in Coca-Cola, but it was actually a
       "Wonder Drug" in the late 1800s. It would be used in all kinds
       of medicine and could be consumed in many different ways.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2- The Moon is <i>not</i> hollow. Please stop.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3- If you ever think about killing somebody, bury the body by the
    river. It will rot a lot faster by water. Even if it doesn't work, the
    police will call you smart!*</p>

    <p>*I do not endorse murder pls dont kill anyone.</p>
