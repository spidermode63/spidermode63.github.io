    I am a massive advocate for space travel and I like a lot of space stuff because I'm a complete nerd, 
    so here's some cool stuff :)

<h2>31/09/21--Important Space Update</h2>
    <p>Starship is almost ready to fly! To orbit! SN20 is fully built, the heat sheild is ready with no cracked tiles, and BN4
         is currently being fidgeted around with on the launch pad while they wait for SN20 to arrive. Also, a Quick Disconnect 
         Arm has arrived to help the massive spaceship exist, and they already transported the booster catching claws that will 
         catch BN5 next year! (The picture below is not how it looks now, this was just a fit test, but it looks very similar to
         how it should look when it launches!)</p>

<h2>Why the shuttle was really cool and it's a shame it was discontinued</h2>

<img src="../Images/shuttle.jpg" width="400px">
<p>Look at that picture and say it's not cool. The only reason it was dangerous is because NASA didn't have enough funding.
    <br>
    anyways that's pretty much it there you go :)

<h1>By the way, Mars is not hot</h1>
<p>
    Unless you count really cold as hot, Mars is cold. A lot of people think it's hot because it's red, but it's actually freezing cold.
