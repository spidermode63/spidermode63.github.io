        Still in denial about the robot. I was learning OpenGL earlier but I lost interest,
        so I'm probably going to play Minecraft with my friends. Speaking of friends, I met a
        new friend on Discord today, so I'll talk to him a bit too maybe.

        Just got back from school and started eating dry cereal and drinking pepsi. I'm
        about to start a group call with my friends and play Minecraft. Until then, I'm just
        going to be here. Also, I'm pretty angry about some idiot in robotics class yesterday
        who ruined my chance at making a really cool robot because he thought it would be a
        great idea to start tossing vex parts across the room and now we're not allowed to
        do anything fun at study hall for the rest of the year because my teacher snapped.
        Also just watched <a href="https://youtu.be/bIMrn9BE_bU">this</a>  really cool cg demo.
        anyways bye :)

    <p>Not really much to talk about but here's a blog or something like that.
        I'm probably just going to write in it after school, but it's still fun to do.
        Currently procrastinating on some really easy homework so I'm going to do that now,
        bye.
