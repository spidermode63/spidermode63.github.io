<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr>
<p>Hi this is me, Austin. I was born on August 30, 2007.
    I am a 14 year old male and I am constantly doing
    everything in my power to absorb knowledge so that I can one day take
    over the world. (there's a reason all the girls call me the selfish jerk)
    I have a lot of interests in a lot of different areas like programming,
    drawing, art, and baking. It used to bother me and make me severely
    depressed and hopeless at the prospect of never getting a job I loved before
    I watched a philosophy video that said it's okay because humans are supposed
    to do that so yeah. I'll probably spend a lot of time here rambling about
    whatever interests me most. You may also notice that this website appears to
    be made in around 500 BC, but I like it that way rather than all clean and
    fancy. I don't really have much else to say so yeah bye. Also enjoy this
    horrifying visage below in your nightmares.
