    <h1>POE-1</h1>
    <a href="../space.html" class="button">go back?</a>
    <br>
    <p>The name is currently a code-word. There is not yet a name for this engine. POE stands for "pineapple of engineering". Very unfunny, I know. I made it up in Math class.</p>
    <p>The POE-1 is made almost entirely out of copper. The fuel injector will be made from brass instead.</p>
    <p>The copper pipes in this image are for the cooling system, passing water through the engine. These pipes will not be copper in real life due to corrosion issues.</p>
    <p>The steel pipes are for Methanol and Gaseous Oxygen. The weird pink pipe is for propane to flow through just one time to ignite the engine.</p>
    <img src="../img/engines/poe1.png" width="50%">
    <p>The previously mentioned brass fuel injector is located near the top of the combustion chamber. It is structured so that The high pressure gaseous oxygen will form a cylinder.
        This cylinder will then <br>collide with a cone of high pressure liquid methanol. This should (hopefully) create a good-ish mixture. If not, well, I don't really care it's my first
        serious engine.
    </p>
    <p>Cold water will pass through the copper pipe, into the torus shape at the top, and through 4 very small pipes. These pipes will greatly increase water pressure. This high pressure<br>
        water will then flow through flat spray nozzles from a catalog I found a while ago. These will deliver a mostly uniform fill of water <br>within the cooling jacket. That water will then
        run through the jacket, cooling the engine, before being dumped overboard through holes around the nozzle. <br>This will also create a cool looking effect where the blue engine exhaust
        will kind of look like it's getting pulled away from the nozzle.
    </p>
    <p>Being copper, the entire engine will suffer heavy corrosion, and be unsalvagable.</p>
    <p>The engine also holds no turbomachinery. It will be a pressure-fed cycle.</p>
