    <p>Hello, my name is Austin. I can see that you use the internet as well. That's great!</p>
    <p>I make music (though I'm not very good at it), art, and other stuff.</p>
    <p>I also try to design theoretical rocket engines that I could build if I had the money and didn't have the age restrictions.</p>

    <p>I make visual effects and CGI with Blender for fun. I think that some of the things I make are kinda cool, so I'll put them online :)</p>
    <a href="space.html"><h1>SPACE</h1></a>
    <p>I'm going to start a space company one day. For now I can only make plans.</p>
