    <h1>WARNING: You have entered cyberspace</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Cyberspace is a strange, horribly distorted realm that lies inside of our own physical realm. By being connected to the internet, you are joined to cyberspace.
        In cyberspace, or CS as I'll start abbreviating it on this site, you can reach almost any information held by the human species. This information is being
        transmitted through an invisible form of light, known as radio. Your computational devices can see this light, and translate it into something valuable. It is
        up to you how you sail the oceans of CS, but be warned, there are sirens. They will steal your time, attention, and money if you listen to their songs. Clickbait,
         drugs, scams, porn, and feed-based social medias are common examples of these sirens. You have been warned. I can assure you, however, that the following corner
         of cyberspace is safe and siren free. I am working hard to create something enjoyable here.
