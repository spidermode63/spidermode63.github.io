    <h1>AUSTIN</h1>
    <h2>MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Hello, my name is Austin. I can see that you use the internet as well. That's great!</p>
    <p>I don't have a purpose for existing. The Universe is completely pointless. We are probably a computer simulation on one of trillions of computers in the real world.</p>

    <h1>VFX</h1>
    <p>I make visual effects and CGI with Blender for fun. I think that some of the things I make are kinda cool, so I'll put them online :)</p>
    <h1>SPACE</h1>
    <p>I am learning rocket science so that I can design rocket engines and space equipment. I hope to one day create a proper space company.</p>
